_Data Quality:_

Concern: There are repeated entries for the same Person ID (e.g., Person ID 123456789). Should we handle or investigate these duplicates before loading? 

Concern: The "Audited" column contains NULL values. How should we handle missing values, and is it critical for the analysis? 

Question: Are the data types for each column aligned with the database schema, especially considering the mixed data types in the "Who Audited" column (names and NULL)? 

Question: Are there any specific requirements or standards for the date format in the "Date Created" column? Are all dates in the same format? 

Concern: The "Who Audited" column contains names. Should we validate these names against a reference list or ensure there is consistency in naming conventions? 

Question: Are there any constraints on the range of values for the "Amount" column? Are negative values allowed? 

Concern: Are there constraints or validations for the "Person ID" column to ensure it corresponds to valid individuals in the system? 

Question: What does the "Audited" column represent (values 0 and 1)? Should we consider mapping these to more descriptive labels for clarity? 

Data Source and Origin: 

Question: Where did the client source this data, and are there any specific considerations or concerns related to the data's origin? 

Question: Is it coming from multiple sources or a single source? 

Question: How often is the data refreshed? New rows are added. 

Audit Trail: 

Concern: The dataset seems to represent an audit trail, given the "Who Audited" and "Audited" columns. Are there specific requirements for maintaining this audit trail in the database? 

Business Requirement: 

What business questions need to be answered after uploading this data? 

Performance: 

How large is the dataset? Will the volume impact database performance? 

Do we have indexes on columns frequently used for querying? 

Are there any long-running queries that might impact database performance during the data load? 

Have we considered the optimal data types for each column to balance storage and query performance? 

PII (Personally Identifiable Information): 

Does the dataset contain any sensitive personal information (PII)? 

Is the Person ID field considered PII, and if so, how will it be handled to ensure privacy? 

Should we implement encryption or other security measures for certain columns? 

Have we considered data anonymization techniques if PII is present and unnecessary for analysis? 

Data Relationships: 

Are there relationships with other existing datasets, and how will they be managed? 

Do we need to establish foreign key relationships for integrity? 

Data Use and Access: 

Who will have access to this data, and what level of permissions should be granted? 

Have we considered implementing role-based access control (RBAC)? 

Data Retention: 

What is the retention policy for this data? Do we need to archive or purge old records? 

 

These questions and concerns aim to ensure the data's quality, consistency, and compatibility with the company's database and business requirements before proceeding with the data load.  

Addressing these questions will help ensure a smooth and secure data loading process, balancing performance considerations with data quality and privacy concerns.
